ðŸš€ Project Update: Setting up Minikube using Shell Scripting! ðŸš€

 Overview

This repository contains a shell script designed to automate the setup of Minikube on CentOS. The script streamlines the installation process of Docker CE, Minikube, and kubectl, ensuring a consistent and error-free deployment of a local Kubernetes environment.

 Features

- Automated Docker CE Installation: Installs Docker CE, the container runtime for Minikube.
- Docker Configuration: Configures Docker for seamless operation, including setting user permissions.
- Minikube Installation: Downloads and installs the latest Minikube binary.
- kubectl Installation: Installs kubectl, the command-line tool for Kubernetes.
- Minikube Cluster Setup: Starts a Minikube cluster using Docker as the driver.

 Benefits

- Efficiency: Reduces the time and effort required to set up a local Kubernetes environment.
- Consistency: Ensures a uniform setup process across different machines and environments.
- Error Reduction: Minimizes human errors by automating the setup steps.
- Scalability: Facilitates quick and easy setup for multiple users or machines.

 Usage

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/minikube-setup-script.git
   cd minikube-setup-script
   ```

2. Make the Script Executable:
   ```sh
   chmod +x setup-minikube.sh
   ```

3. Run the Script:
   ```sh
   ./setup-minikube.sh
   ```

 Requirements

- CentOS with `dnf` package manager installed.
- `curl` for downloading Minikube and kubectl binaries.
- Internet connection to access external repositories and binaries.

 Script Breakdown

- Adding Docker Repository: Adds Dockerâ€™s official repository to the system.
- Verifying Repository: Confirms the repository has been added successfully.
- Installing Docker CE: Installs Docker CE along with necessary dependencies.
- Configuring Docker: Adjusts permissions and adds the current user to the Docker group.
- Starting Docker Service: Starts and enables Docker to run on system boot.
- Verifying Docker Installation: Runs a test container to ensure Docker is installed correctly.
- Installing Minikube: Downloads and installs the Minikube binary.
- Installing kubectl: Downloads and installs the latest stable version of kubectl.
- Starting Minikube Cluster: Initializes a Minikube cluster using Docker as the driver.

 Future Enhancements

- Enhanced Error Handling: Adding more robust error checks and handling.
- Logging: Implementing logging mechanisms for better troubleshooting and visibility.
- Custom Configurations: Allowing users to customize Minikube and Docker settings.
- Compatibility: Exploring support for other Linux distributions.
